# Adaptive-Satellite-Drone-Image-Dehazing-using-Enhanced-DCP
This project implements an adaptive image dehazing system for satellite and drone imagery using an enhanced Dark Channel Prior (DCP) technique. It removes atmospheric haze from RGB images without requiring any training data, making it ideal for resource-constrained deployments like drones or edge devices.
